Work Experience
Software Engineer, Voyance 2023 – Present
Contributed to the end-to-end development of a large-scale, cloud-native medical imaging platform (VPAX) and its associated 
C# acquisition software (VoyanceX). Worked across the full stack, from backend microservices and databases to the responsive 
ReactJS micro-frontend. Authored system design documentation and maintained system security.
Key Projects & Achievements:
•VPAX (Cloud-Native Medical Imaging Platform):
•Architecture & Performance: Engineered the system to handle 150x peak traffic loads and cut database costs by over 
30% by implementing advanced query optimizations and caching strategies, which also significantly improved query 
performance.
•AI Integration: Integrated generative AI models into core healthcare workflows, boosting practitioner efficiency.
•Frontend: Actively contributed to the full frontend lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to building production-ready features. 
Focused on enhancing UX/UI and helped decrease application load times by 25% through performance investigation, 
optimization, and implementing a Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern.
•Security: Implemented a granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, ensuring strict, secure data isolation in a 
complex multi-tenant platform.
•Integrations: Developed seamless integrations with external cloud providers, including Dropbox and OneDrive, to 
streamline user data workflows.
•VoyanceX (X-Ray Acquisition Software):
•Core Development: Developed and maintained the C# acquisition software, ensuring its seamless integration with the 
VPAX cloud system.
•Hardware Integration: Enhanced hardware compatibility across diverse client setups by integrating the software with new 
devices.
Freelance Development 2021 – 2023
•Developed and deployed custom websites for clients using technologies such as NodeJS, WordPress, and Moodle. 
•Managed continuous client communication to ensure the delivered solutions were perfectly aligned with their needs.
